Python Pygame mini-project. We present an example of the application of the coding to the section of school physics: 
convex lens simulation. Object (triangle) is located from the left side of the lens and itâ€™s position can be shifted
with left or right arrow PC key buttons. When the distance between object and lens is more than focal distance the 
real image of the object is positioned from the right side of the lens and the magnification and distance between 
the image and the lens are determined by the basic convex lens formula. If the distance between the object and the 
lens is less than focal distance we see virtual image from the same side. This interactive simulation allows learners 
of school Physics to explore core physics concept as well as modern computer language Python. The files for modeling 
this scenario can be downloaded free of charge at:
